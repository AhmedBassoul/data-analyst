Welcome to my data analysis project on estimating age in France using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In this project, I explored a dataset from INSEE (Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques) containing demographic and behavioral features to develop a model for estimating the age of individuals in France. This repository contains all the code, data, and documentation related to the project.

Objective:

The main objective of this project was to utilize PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving most of the important information. By doing so, we aimed to identify the key features that contribute to age estimation and build a regression model for predicting age with improved accuracy.

Key Steps:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: I gathered a dataset from INSEE containing various features such as demographic information, behavioral data, and physiological attributes. After preprocessing the data to handle missing values and encode categorical variables, I proceeded to explore its structure and characteristics.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Utilizing PCA, I reduced the dimensionality of the dataset to extract the most important features contributing to age estimation. By retaining a certain number of principal components, I aimed to capture a significant portion of the variance within the data.

Interpretation and Visualization: Through visualizations and interpretation of the results, I gained insights into the factors influencing age estimation. I analyzed the importance of different features and how they contribute to the accuracy of the age prediction model.

Conclusion:

Through this project, I demonstrated the effectiveness of PCA in reducing the dimensionality of the dataset and improving the accuracy of age estimation. By leveraging machine learning techniques and exploratory data analysis, I gained valuable insights into the factors influencing age in France.

Feel free to explore the repository, replicate the analysis, and provide feedback. I welcome contributions and collaboration from the community to further enhance this project.
